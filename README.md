### 🌍 Climate Models: From Simple to GraphCast

**[`climate_models_blog.ipynb`](./climate_models_blog.ipynb)** - A comprehensive journey through climate modeling

**[📄 View as PDF](./climate_models_blog.pdf)** - Pre-executed notebook with all outputs and visualizations

Build 5 climate models of increasing sophistication:
1. **0D Energy Balance Model** - Global mean temperature
2. **1D Radiative-Convective Model** - Vertical atmospheric structure
3. **2D Statistical Model** - Latitude variations and ice-albedo feedback
4. **3D General Circulation Model** - Full spatial dynamics
5. **GraphCast ML Model** - Modern AI/ML approach

Each model includes:
- 2-page technical explanation of assumptions and approximations
- Complete Python implementation
- Comprehensive visualizations
- Climate change analysis

**Key Results**: Shows model convergence on ~3°C climate sensitivity (matching IPCC), demonstrates polar amplification, analyzes feedbacks, and justifies climate change projections.

**Quick Start**: `pip install -r requirements.txt && jupyter notebook`
